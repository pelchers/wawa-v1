can you assure that each of our individual @sections pages match exactly to the sections they reference from the @home.tsx page but rather than ending at that level of detail, each of the seubsections from those home page sections in this 1-01 relationship are expanded on (not altering the existing content of those sections but adding to it via sub bullets, sub sub secttions, etc) ... this way when the user goes from home to the sections expanded page... they get basically the same layout but just with many more subdetails within each of the original subsections of each section on the home page... make sense?... if so write a little guide for how to implement this in the @1-time-instructions folder

also in the guide note the importance of a consistent layout to assure the user understands whats being expanded on without havign to reread for posterity sake when they go from home to the expanded section page of any section... also every section page should have a comment field and a question field as well as an approval button with star rating at the bottom of the page... then below that is a set of lists for approvals comments and questions below that (3 separate lists of these db submissions by logged in users)... 

# Section Page Expansion Guide

## Overview

This guide explains how to maintain consistency between sections on the home page and their corresponding dedicated section pages, while expanding the content on the dedicated pages.

## Implementation Principles

1. **1-to-1 Relationship**: Each section on the home page should have a corresponding dedicated page that expands on its content.

2. **Content Preservation**: The dedicated section page should include all content from the home page section, maintaining the same structure and organization.

3. **Content Expansion**: The dedicated section page should expand on the home page content by adding:
   - More detailed explanations
   - Additional sub-bullets under existing bullet points
   - Sub-sections that elaborate on topics mentioned in the home page
   - Supporting data, charts, or examples
   - Related considerations or implications

4. **Visual Consistency**: The dedicated section page should use the same visual styling and components as the home page section, ensuring a seamless transition for users.

5. **Layout Consistency**: Maintain the same visual layout and structure between the home page section and its expanded version to ensure users can immediately recognize and understand the expanded content without having to reorient themselves.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Analyze Home Page Section

For each section on the home page:
- Identify the main headings and subheadings
- Note the key points and content structure
- Understand the visual components used (cards, tables, lists, etc.)

### 2. Create or Update Section Page

When creating or updating a dedicated section page:
- Use the `SectionPage` component as the wrapper
- Include the same main heading as on the home page
- Maintain the same subheadings and structure
- Preserve all content from the home page section

### 3. Expand Content

After ensuring all original content is preserved, expand the section by:
- Adding more detailed explanations to existing paragraphs
- Expanding bullet points with sub-bullets
- Adding new subsections that elaborate on topics mentioned briefly on the home page
- Including additional examples, data points, or case studies
- Adding supporting visuals or interactive elements where appropriate

### 4. Example Expansion Patterns

#### For Text Paragraphs:
- Keep the original paragraph
- Add 1-2 additional paragraphs that provide more context, examples, or implications

#### For Bullet Lists:
- Keep all original bullet points
- Add 2-3 sub-bullets under each main bullet that provide more specific details
- Consider adding a "Learn more about..." paragraph after the list

#### For Data Visualizations:
- Keep the original visualization
- Add additional breakdowns, comparisons, or trend analyses
- Include explanatory text that interprets the data in more depth

#### For Process Steps:
- Keep the original steps
- Add sub-steps or considerations for each main step
- Include potential challenges and solutions for each step

### 5. Navigation

Ensure proper navigation between the home page and section pages:
- The home page should link to each section page
- Each section page should include navigation to the previous and next sections
- Consider adding a "Back to Overview" link that returns to the home page

### 6. Required Interactive Elements

Every section page must include the following interactive elements at the bottom:

#### User Interaction Components
- **Approval Button**: Include a prominent approval button with a star rating system (1-5 stars)
- **Comment Field**: Provide a text area for users to submit general comments about the section
- **Question Field**: Include a separate text area for users to submit specific questions about the content

#### User Submission Lists
Below the interactive components, include three separate lists:
- **Approvals List**: Display all user approvals with their ratings and timestamps
- **Comments List**: Show all submitted comments with user information and timestamps
- **Questions List**: Present all submitted questions, potentially with status indicators for answered/unanswered

These elements should be consistently implemented across all section pages to provide a uniform user experience for feedback and interaction.

## Layout Consistency Guidelines

To ensure users can easily transition from the home page to expanded section pages:

1. **Visual Continuity**: Use the same color schemes, card styles, and visual elements between the home page section and its expanded version.

2. **Content Recognition**: Begin each section page with content that is identical to what appears on the home page before introducing expanded material.

3. **Expansion Indicators**: Consider using visual cues (such as indentation, different background shades, or expansion icons) to clearly indicate which content is expanded from the original.

4. **Consistent Headings Hierarchy**: Maintain the same heading levels and hierarchy from the home page, with expanded content using appropriate sub-headings.

5. **Familiar Components**: If a specific component (like a data card or process step) appears on the home page, use the same component design on the section page before adding expanded details.

This consistent layout approach ensures users don't need to reread or reorient themselves when navigating from the home page to a specific section page, as they'll immediately recognize the familiar content before engaging with the expanded material.

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing a section page expansion, verify that:
- All content from the home page section is preserved
- The expanded content maintains the same tone and style
- The visual presentation is consistent with the home page
- The additional content provides genuine value, not just filler
- Navigation between pages is intuitive and functional
- All required interactive elements (approval, comments, questions) are properly implemented
- The layout maintains visual continuity with the home page section

By following these guidelines, we'll create a seamless experience where users can get a high-level overview on the home page and then dive deeper into specific sections of interest, while also having the opportunity to provide feedback and engage with the content.
